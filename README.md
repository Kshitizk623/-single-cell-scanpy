Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis with Scanpy
This repository contains code for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data using Scanpy. The dataset used is related to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

Features
Preprocessing: Loading and filtering single-cell data.
Quality Control: Checking mitochondrial/ribosomal genes.
Normalization & Scaling: Log-normalization and variance stabilization.
Dimensionality Reduction: PCA and UMAP for visualization.
Clustering: Identifying cell populations.
Differential Expression Analysis: Finding marker genes.
