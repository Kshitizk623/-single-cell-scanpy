# üß¨ Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis of Pancreatic Cancer (PDAC)

This repository contains the analysis pipeline for exploring **single-cell transcriptomic differences** between **normal and tumor samples** in **pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)**. The project applies dimensionality reduction, clustering, differential gene expression, and functional enrichment techniques to reveal tumor-specific biological insights at single-cell resolution.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Objective**: Identify molecular and cellular differences between tumor and normal cells in PDAC using single-cell RNA-seq data.
- **Approach**: Dual-path analysis using **separate** and **combined** representations of tumor and normal samples.
- **Key Highlights**:
  - Unsupervised clustering of cell populations
  - DEG analysis at both global (tumor vs normal) and local (within clusters) levels
  - Functional enrichment and pathway analysis (GO & KEGG)
  - Automated cell type annotation using reference datasets
